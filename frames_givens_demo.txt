#   Python/SymPy/GAlgebra program source for numerical frame transformation 
# and versor decomposition into fixed-axis (Givens') rotations, with demo & test 
# harness, for real Clifford algebra  Cl(p,q,r) . 
# Version 2.2; date: 24/07/16; author: Fred Lunnon <Fred.Lunnon@gmail.com> 

  Assistance from Alan Cortzen and Warren D. Smith concerning the algorithms 
for frame conversion and Givens factorisation is hereby acknowledged. 

  The module was designed with portability and robustness in mind, rather than 
optimal resource usage or serpentine virtuosity.  Time and space demands should 
improve with tailoring specific to the language and application at hand: 
numerical computation in SymPy currently manifests gross inefficiencies, 
caused at least in part by inappropriate lazy evaluation.  
Customary industrial-scale line-breaking conventions have been ignored: 
I can't make sense of anything that doesn't fit on a single page !  

  The algorithms perform reliably on numerical data: although round-off error 
is checked, stability is in practice excellent, away from isotropic regions.  
However (as with matrices) when both  p, q  are nonzero, normalising a versor 
which is approaching isotropy (zero magnitude) yields large components, 
leading to increasingly severe cancellation error. 

  Compared with matrix computation, GA involves nontrivial issues concerning 
continuity and sign, resulting in part from mismatches between left- and 
right-hand frames, even- and odd-grade versors, etc, as discussed in the 
specifications below.  Competent application to situations such as continuous 
motion interpolation requires awareness of these. 

  Caveat: within this module, matrices and versors compose LEFT-TO-RIGHT, eg. 
    matrix  K  acts on row vector  v  via  v <- v K ; 
    versor  X  transforms  Z  via  Z <- (1/X) Z X ; 
    transformation  X  followed by  Y  requires  X Y ; 
Use in an application with opposite conventions would require the user to 
transpose / revert inputs and outputs, and reverse the order of compositions, 
at the interface. [ It may be feasible to automate this pesky 4-way switch! ] 

  Notation:  Cl(p,q,r)  denotes the mixed degenerate Clifford algebra with 
components real, generators  e_i  where  i = 1,...,n , and  (e_i)^2 = 
    +1  for  0 < i <= p , -1  for  p < i <= p+q , 0  for  p+q< i <= p+q+r = n ; 
this ordering is required by the package. 
O(p,q,r)  denotes the mixed orthonormal group of square matrices, acting on 
row vectors of dimension  n , and preserving the corresponding (metric) diagonal 
matrix under conjugacy.  

  Versor composition or matrix product are denoted by  X Y ; versor reversion 
or matrix inversion by  (1/X) ; matrices and versors are usually implicitly 
normalised, with magnitude  ||X|| in {+1, -1, 0}  as appropriate. 
Grade-k  subvector by  <X>_k .  Addition by  X+Y  or  X-Y  as usual: 
note that this operation does not preserve versors, and is not preserved 
under the homomorphism from normalised versors to orthonormal matrices.

  Specifications and algorithmic details follow: the principal functions are 
    frame_transform_versor(), 
    givens_factor_matrix(),  
    givens_factor_versor(),  
each equipped with verbose option for demonstration and debugging.  
Below the fold the source comprises a substantial testbed harness: 
    spin_disc(), 
    test_main() 
contain examples of usage of the principal functions. 


  Variable:  eps = 1.0E-12 

  Usage:  Determines the (absolute) rounding error considered acceptable; 
default assumes double-length real precision (64-bit floating-point). 
Norms and components smaller than this quantity are interpreted as zero; 
"equality" between numerical  b, c  is implemented as  |b - c| < eps . 


  Function:  versor_to_matrix (X), matrix_to_versor (A, Z0 = 0) 

  Input & output:  normalised versor & corresponding matrix, or vice-versa. 

  Method:  The former is trivial: matrix entry  A_ij  is simply the component 
of  e_i  in the action of  X  on  e_j .  The latter in contrast employs 
frame_transform_versor()  to transform the unit frame into one whose vectors are 
the rows of  A ; therefore the same continuity and sign issues are involved. 


  Function: frame_transform_versor (F, G, verb = False, Z0 = 0) 

  Input:  Orthonormal numerical versors  F_1 .. F_n ; G_1 .. G_n  in  
Cl(n, p, q) ; optional boolean  verb  invokes verbosity;  
Z0  recalls previous output. 

  Output:  Normal versor  Z  such that  G_k = (1/Z) F_k Z  for  k = 1 ..n . 
An error message results if output rounding error exceeds global bound  eps , 
frame signatures are incompatible, or continuity cannot be established. 

  Method:  At stage  k  start,  t (1/Z) F_k Z_k = G_i  for  i < k , and is orthogonal to  G_1 .. G_(k-1)  for  i >= k .  Versor  R_k  transforms  H_k  
into  G_k  without altering  H_1 .. H_(k-1) : if angle  u  between them exceeds 
threshold (say  pi/8 ) assign reflection  R , otherwise rotation ; 	 --- ?? 
this avoids singularities at  u = 0, pi  for reflection, rotation resp. 

  s,t  track sign-change due to reflection at stage  k  and overall resp. 
Pseudocode below omits implicit renormalisation, and error / continuity checks.  
Note that finally at  k = n , always  R = +/-1  approx. 

  Pseudocode: 
  
    Z := I;  t := 1; 
    FOR  k := 1 .. n  DO 
      H_k := t <(1/Z) F_i Z>_1; 
      R1 := G_k - H_k;  m1 := ||R1||;  n1 := min(|m1|, 1.0/|m1|); 
      R2 := 1 + H_k G_k;  m2 := ||R2||;  n2 := min(|m2|, 1.0/|m2|); 
      IF  max(n1, n2) < 0  # if signatures clash or both isotropic, 
      THEN  R_k := 1;  s := 1;  # copy across 
      ELIF  n1 > n2  # else stabler of 
      THEN  R_k := R1;  s := -sign(m1);  # co-point reflection 
      ELSE  R_k := R2;  s := sign(m2);  FI  # co-line rotation 
      Z := Z R_k;  t := t*s;  # accumulated transform & sign 
    OD  # finally  (1/Z) F Z  =  +/-G ,  Z  =  prod_k R ; 

    IF  t < 0  # perhaps fix wrong signs (isotropic case?) 
    THEN  Z := Z e_1 ... e_(p+q);  FI 

  Sign and continuity issues:  Frames  F, G  may have mismatched senses: one 
left- and the other right-handed, their corresponding orthonormal matrices 
having different determinants; or otherwise incompatible isotropic generator 
signs.  Regardless, on termination of the loop above, the result may be  H = -G  
instead: when  p  is even and  r  zero, this is corrected via replacing  Z  
with its dual. Similarly, when  p  is odd and  r  nonzero, the sign of all 
isotropics alone may be corrected via the non-isotropic partial dual (currently 
unimplemented).  Unreconcilable sign mismatches report a large final error.  

  Again, the sign of  Z  as earlier computed may flip randomly in the course of 
a sequence of transformations intended by the user to approximate continuity. 
To avoid this, option  Z0  should be loaded with the previous output: either 
the algorithm  adjusts the output sign to match, or an error message results. 
Furthermore when  p  is odd, it is possible that  Z  might flip between 
the expected versor and its dual: to maintain continuity, the algorithm 
adjusts this situation as well. [ Truly, nothing is simple! ] 


  Function: givens_factor_matrix (B, verb = False) 

  Input:  Orthonormal order-n  matrix  B ; optional boolean  verb  invokes 
verbosity. 

  Output:  Sequence of Givens' rotations  R_k  such that  B = |B| R_1 .. R_m , 
where  m = n(n-1)/2 .  An error message results if output rounding error 
exceeds global bound  eps . 

  Method:  With  A = (1/B)  initially, at stage  k  clear some  A_ij := 0  
in the upper triangle  i < j  via post-multiplication by Givens' rotation  
R_ij(u_k) .  Orthonormality is conserved; finally the upper triangle 
is empty, and via orthogonality so is the lower, and  A  has been reduced 
to unit matrix.  

  Sequence  (i,j)_k  is designed to avoid overwriting previously established 
zeros, in either upper or lower triangle: this method utilises 
    (i,j)  =  (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), ...  
Both angles  u, u+pi  clear entry  A_ij  equally effectively: the choice made 
ensures  B_ii > 0  subsequently, so that the diagonal becomes finally positive. 

  Pseudocode:  
    A := B;  C := I;  
    FOR  j := 1 .. n  DO  FOR  i := 1 .. j-1  DO  
        R_k := givens(i, j, A_ii, A_ij); 
        A := A R_k;  C := (1/R_k) C ;  OD OD  # new A_ij = 0 , A_ii > 0 
    # finally  A = diag(1, ..., 1, +/-1) ,  C = B  (except row  n ?) 

  Here  givens(i, j, t, s)  denotes Givens' matrix  R_ij(u) , representing 
rotation, boost, translation, offset etc. in the  (x_i, x_j)-plane through 
extent specified by ratio  s/t : eg. in the case of rotation, through angle  
2 arctan(s/t) .  The components are those of the unit matrix, excepting 
    R_ii = t/d ,  R_jj = t/d ,  R_ij = -s/d ,  R_ji = (e_i)^2 (e_j)^2 s/d ; 
    where  d = sqrt| (e_j)^2 s - (e_i)^2 t | , or  1  if this vanishes. 
Post-multiplication by  R  alters only columns  i,j  of  A , and conserves 
orthonormality.  The inverse components are the same, except for  R_ij, R_ji  
which are negated. 

  Sign issues:  Product  R_1 .. R_m = B  when  B  is special, representing a 
direct, "orientation-preserving" isometry, with determinant  |B| = 1 ; 
otherwise  R_1 .. R_m = -B . 			 case |B| = 0  --- FIX ?? 


  Function:  givens_factor_versor (Y, verb = False) 

  Input:  spherical versor  Y  in dimension  n ; optional boolean  verb  
invokes verbosity. 

  Output:  Sequence of grade-2 Givens'  R_k  such that  Y = R_1 .. R_m M , 
where  m = n(n-1)/2 , and  M = 1 or e_1 .  An error message (or two) results 
if output rounding error exceeds global bound  eps . 

  Method:  Y  is made even-grade by multiplication by  e_1  if necessary, 
converted to matrix for  givens_factor_matrix()  to process, the result 
converted back via  matrix_to_versor() .  

  Sign issues:  When  Y  has even grade, the product may fail to have the same 
sign as  Y , and the sign of  R_m  is adjusted to correct this.  


  Function:  rand_versor (l), rand_matrix (l) 

  Input:  number of linear factors, usually  l = n  or  l = n-1 . 

  Output:  random normalised versor or orthonormal matrix. 

  Method:  A naïve algorithm would simply return the product  Z = X_1 ... X_l , 
where each vector  X_i  has components distributed uniformly in the signed unit 
interval, via rand_vector().  This is unsatisfactory for hyperbolic versors: 
the result converges rapidly towards an isotropic limit.  Instead return the 
the product of  [l/2]  rotations or boosts of form  1 + X Y  for   X, Y 
random vectors, together with a single extra random vector if  l  is odd.  

  For a random matrix, first generate a random versor, then convert via 
versor_to_matrix().  No effort is made to randomise the sign when  l, n  
are both odd. 
    

  Function:  instantiate_GA (p, q, r)  

  Input:  numbers  p, q, r  of generators squaring to  +1, -1, 0  resp. 

  Output:  Assigns to global variables GA, n, m, p, q, r, gene[], sigs[] . 

  Caveat:  Must be invoked at outer level of user program.  User generator 
identifiers must assigned explicitly: their variables can be recovered from 
global list  gene[] , see  spin_disc()  source for example. 


  Function:  test_main () 

  Output:  Verbose printout from the 3 principal functions, illustrating their 
methods in operation.  Source code comprises simple examples of their usage. 


  Function:  spin_disc (l = 20)  

  Input:  Number of steps  l  of rotation demo (default  20 ) 

  Output:  Printout illustrating spin continuity under continuous rotation, 
and matrix-versor relationship.  Source code contains examples of usage.

		A Note on Duality and Magnitude 

  In his pioneering investigations into Clifford algebras, Hestenes made 
use of two special properties of magnitude and duality: for versor (product of 
grade-1  subvectors)  X  in  Cl(p,q,0) , 
    ||X||  =  X~ X ;  and  X*  =  X J ,  or  X*  =  -J X ,  or  ... ; 
where  Z~  and  Z*  denote reversion (adjoint) and duality operators, and 
J  is (some) pseudoscalar.  In fact he went further than using, to interpreting 
these properties as definitions. 
  The suggestion I want to put forward here is that, while this device may 
be mathematically elegant, it is ultimately computationally inefficient, 
unnecessarily restrictive, and inappropriate in more general situations.  
Specifically, its apparent adoption by the GAlgebra system is resulting in 
avoidable failures. 

  Consider a numerical computation involving approximate real (floating-point) 
quantities.  For  X  a computed versor,  X~ X  will differ from an exact scalar 
by some small rounding error: however  ||X||  is still accurately represented 
by  <X~ X>_0 .  Again, when  X(t)  is a continuous function, the size of its 
increment should still be represented by  ||X(t + dt) - X(t)|| , although that 
increment is no longer even approximately a versor.  For arbitrary  X  these 
requirements are satisfied simply and economically by redefining 

***  ||X||  is a signed sum of all squared components, 
     the precomputed `sign' for each component being  M~ M  
     where  M  denotes the corresponding monomial.  *** 
     
Currently GAlgebra  norm(X)  fails with an error report unless  X  is an 
exact versor, rendering it useless for numerical purposes. 

  Regarding duality, what applications come to mind?  I can summon --- 

  Ex. (1) : generalised Apollonian problem in  3-space Lie-sphere geometry. 
The appropriate algebra is  Cl(4,2,0)  [which physicists confusingly 
denote `conformal', styling proper conformal algebra  Cl(3,1,0)  `Minkowski'].  
Extrinsically oriented  spheres are represented by grade-1  subvectors; the 
pair of spheres tangent to  4  given spheres  X_1,...,X_4  are eigencycles 
of exterior product dual  (X_1 ^ ... ^ X_4)* . 

  Ex. (2) : subspace intersection and union (closure) in  3-space Euclidean 
geometry.  The appropriate algebra is  Cl(3,0,1)  [which should not be 
confused with commonly misnamed  Cl(3,0,0) , quaternions etc doubly covering 
isometries of a sphere centred at the origin].  Subspaces of dimension  k  are 
represented by grade-(4-k) versor subvectors; geometric duality exchanges 
each  k-subspace with an orthogonal  (3-k)-subspace.  The intersection of 
subspaces  X,Y  is given by  X ^ Y ; the union should be given by (X* ^ Y*)* . 

  In ex. (2) the current dual fails, since it deletes all components with 
zero `sign' [indeed, GAlgebra simply refuses to instantiate the degenerate 
algebra at all, though nanny can be circumvented by instead assigning a tiny 
square to the generator].  However in both examples geometrically meaningful 
results follow from redefinition  

***  X*  is the reversion of the `reversal' of  X , constructed 
     by exchanging components having complementary monomials.  *** 

  Furthermore, GAlgebra generalises Hestenes' definitions to permit (dynamic) 
metrics specified by arbitrary diagonal or symmetric matrices.  It is unclear 
to me what geometrical significance duality might now possess; I am unable to 
envisage a situation in which the current definition could produce meaningful 
results.  The manual lists 8 microscopically different options for duality, 
which serves only to reinforce my impression that the existing definition is 
unfit for this extended purpose!  [ The new definition is incompatible with 
all those options for various  Cl(p,q,0) , though not in any geometrically 
significant fashion. ]  

  [ Remark that the exterior product --- defined as the maximal grade subvector 
of the Clifford product --- is not well-defined for numerical approximations, 
without the intended grade being supplied explicitly. ] 

  I invite comments on these proposals.  In particular, I have not attempted 
to generalise them to arbitrary metrics, in the hope of securing advice from 
persons more familiar than myself with relevant applications.
